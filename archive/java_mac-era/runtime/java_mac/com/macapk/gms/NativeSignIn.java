// com.macapk.gms.NativeSignIn -- the bridge to the AppKit sign-in window.
//
// The decision "this needs a Google account" is made in Java, inside a licence
// check; the window is AppKit. This is the seam. Implemented in
// runtime/src/gms_signin.mm and registered in native_methods.cpp.
//
// ⚠ EVERY ENTRY POINT WORKS WITHOUT THE NATIVE. `debug/gms.sh` runs these
// classes on a bare JDK with no runtime binary behind them, and the DEX-conversion
// gates load the framework jar the same way. An UnsatisfiedLinkError there is not
// an error condition, it is "no window is available in this process", which is a
// perfectly ordinary state that the caller must handle anyway (a headless run
// cannot show a window either way). So the link failure is caught once, here, and
// turned into `false` rather than propagating as a crash from inside a licence
// check.
