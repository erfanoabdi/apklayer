// com.macapk.loader.PresentedSdk -- the ONE process-wide answer to "what
// Android version is this device?".
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-08). The runtime used to present FIVE API levels
// at once: Build.SDK_INT said 29, ResourceIndex's CONFIG_DIRS force-served
// values-v31/v34, MACAPK_ARSC_RES_SDK scored qualifiers at 34, apktool's
// framework table was API 36, and the answer-probe golden AVD is API 30.
// Each consumer had papered over the SDK_INT=29 contradiction separately.
// This class is the single source every consumer now derives from:
// Build.VERSION.SDK_INT/RELEASE, SystemProperties ro.build.version.*,
// ResourceIndex's -v<N> qualifier acceptance, and CONFIG_DIRS filtering.
//
// THE PER-APP MODEL (owner call, 2026-08-08: "see what versions of android
// the app supports at runtime and always tell them we are the highest one
// they support"). Real Android's SDK_INT is a device constant, and the
// platform varies BEHAVIOUR per app through targetSdkVersion compat gates
// (hundreds of CompatChanges). Mac.apk runs ONE app per process, so it can
// do something a multi-app device cannot: pick the DEVICE LEVEL per
// process to match the app. From inside the process this is coherent --
// the app observes one level everywhere, exactly as if it were installed
// on a real device of that level -- and it puts every app on the level its
// developers actually tested: their own targetSdk.
//
//   presented = clamp(targetSdkVersion, FLOOR, CEILING)
//
// - targetSdkVersion is NOT "the highest level the app supports" (apps
//   forward-support every future level; the manifest has no max field).
//   It is the behaviour generation the app was DESIGNED against, which is
//   the level whose branches its developers ran. That is the faithful
//   reading of the owner's intent.
// - FLOOR = 29: an app targeting below 29 already runs correctly today
//   being told 29 (the ARM32 fleet: flappy targetSdk 15, hillclimb 28 --
//   both sweep-green), and that is also what the API-30 oracle does to
//   them (old apps on a NEWER device is Android's most-tested compat
//   direction). Reporting an ANCIENT level instead would steer them onto
//   2012-era code paths nothing has tested in a decade, and would drop
//   their -v21+ resource variants. Never lie DOWNWARD past today's value.
// - CEILING = 36 (raised from 34, 2026-08-21). The block here used to say 34
//   was "the level our framework can currently stand behind" and that "35 is out
//   until the edge-to-edge enforcement surface exists: AOSP 15 FORCES
//   edge-to-edge for targetSdk-35 apps, and our window model is the OPPOSITE of
//   what that needs". **That reasoning is REFUTED and the ceiling it justified
//   was protecting nothing.**
//
//   Measured, three ways:
//   * `MACAPK_SDK_INT` forced on EVERY app regardless of targetSdk -- the
//     one-level model -- gives a protected sweep of PASS=11 REGRESS=0 at 35, at
//     36 AND at 37. flappy (targetSdk 15) and hcr181 (targetSdk 16, ARM32) both
//     PASS while being told they are on API 37, verified from their own logs
//     (`presenting API 37`) rather than from the env we set.
//   * The Canvas fleet at forced-36 against the per-app clamp, same build: 12 of
//     16 apps >= 99.3% identical, including every app that ships `-v35`
//     resources (deskclock, anki, wikipedia, opensudoku all 99.98%). The three
//     movers are the fleet's known content-drifty apps, each inside its own
//     documented range.
//   * Grepped at v1.0.1012: `sDecorFitsSystemWindows` is pinned true at every
//     presented level, nothing in `runtime/` matches
//     `isEdgeToEdgeEnforced|windowOptOutEdgeToEdge`, and NOT ONE of the four
//     real `PresentedSdk` readers is a comparison. A ceiling lift cannot change
//     one line of our window arithmetic, so the window model was never the gate.
//     (UPDATED 2026-09-26, wave 5 w5-windecor: that grep is no longer empty.
//     The FIRST PresentedSdk comparison is android.app.Activity
//     .macapkIsEdgeToEdgeEnforced -- android15 PhoneWindow's enforcement for a
//     targetSdk>=35 app on a presented 35+ device, which makes the bar-colour
//     GETTERS answer TRANSPARENT and setStatusBarColor a no-op; bisect with
//     MACAPK_EDGE_TO_EDGE=0 / MACAPK_WINDOW_BAR_COLORS=0. It changes answers,
//     not window arithmetic: sDecorFitsSystemWindows is still pinned true and
//     the E2E LAYOUT half is not implemented.
//     docs/window-decor-title-barcolours-styleable_2026-09-26.md)
//
//   ⚠ WHAT THE SWEEP COULD NOT SEE, stated because it is the honest half: the
//   12 protected apps top out at `-v31` (mindustry/bouncy `-v26`, subwaysurf
//   `-v31`), so a green sweep at 35/36/37 is evidence about the CODE half only.
//   The resource half lives in the Canvas fleet, which is why both were run.
//
//   ⚠ AND THE REFERENCE IS NOT LEVEL-MATCHED: the golden AVD is pinned to
//   `system-images;android-30` (android-emulator/setup.sh:63-64), i.e. Android
//   11. We already serve v31/v34 fleet-wide, so we are ALREADY ahead of it; at
//   36 we serve v35 too. Where that diverges we are MORE correct and will score
//   WORSE, and no instrument we own separates that from a regression. Per the
//   alpha-software rule that is a cost to notate, not a reason to hold.
//
//   37 is deliberately NOT taken. No `android17-release` branch exists on the
//   AOSP mirror, so every future question about it would be documentation-only,
//   and exactly one corpus app targets it. `MAX_KNOWN_SDK` is already 37 and
//   `MACAPK_SDK_INT=37` already works, so this is a one-line revisit the day the
//   branch cuts.
//
//   Override without rebuilding: MACAPK_SDK_CEILING=<n>, clamped to
//   [FLOOR, MAX_KNOWN_SDK].
//
// GATES. MACAPK_SDK_INT is default-unset; MACAPK_SDK_FROM_TARGET is DEFAULT-ON
// since v1.0.1012 (set it to 0 to restore the flat DEFAULT_SDK in one run).
// (This block used to claim MACAPK_SDK_FROM_TARGET was "DEFAULT-ON since
// v1.0.1004". That was never true of the code below it -- the branch tests
// `"1".equals(getenv(...))`, so an unset var presents 29 -- and the claim
// survived the same evening's revert, contradicting the comment 30 lines down
// that records it. Corrected 2026-08-20; a stale gate default in this file is
// expensive because every consumer derives its level from here.)
//   MACAPK_SDK_INT=<n>        absolute override, wins over everything.
//   MACAPK_SDK_FROM_TARGET=0  DISABLES the per-app clamp and restores the flat
//                             DEFAULT_SDK. Anything else (unset included) keeps
//                             the clamp ON. It needs the APK path; it reads
//                             MACAPK_APK_PATH (exported by the native launcher;
//                             see below), else stays inert with one loud log line.
//
// WHY AN ENV VAR AND NOT A Boot-time SETTER: Build.VERSION.SDK_INT must be
// a static final int, so its value is fixed at Build.VERSION class-init,
// and ANY framework class's <clinit> may touch Build.VERSION before Boot
// reaches its manifest parse (SystemProperties does, ResourceIndex does).
// Environment variables are process-constant from birth, so reading them
// here is safe no matter which class loads first. The APK path therefore
// also has to arrive via env; until the native side exports it, a manual
// run passes it by hand:
//   MACAPK_SDK_FROM_TARGET=1 MACAPK_APK_PATH=app.apk macapk-runtime --apk app.apk
