// android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager -- the camera2 entry point.
// Mac.apk has no camera, which in AOSP terms is exactly the
// CameraManagerGlobal.sCameraServiceDisabled state, and AOSP has a precise
// contract for it: getCameraIdList returns an empty array, and every id-taking
// entry point throws IllegalArgumentException("No cameras available on
// device") SYNCHRONOUSLY, before any StateCallback is constructed or touched
// (CameraManager.java:770-771 getCameraCharacteristics, :1503-1504
// openCameraImpl, :1552-1553 setTorchMode). Reproducing that exactly is what
// lets camera apps probe-and-degrade the same way they do on a real cameraless
// device.
//
// The "no cameras" decision itself now lives in ONE place -- the package-private
// CameraBackend -- so that wiring a real AVFoundation capture backend is a
// change to that class rather than an audit of every throw site in this
// package. The AOSP citations below are preserved because they are why each
// site throws what it throws.
