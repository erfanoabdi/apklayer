// android.view.SurfaceView -- a View that owns an off-thread drawing
// surface. AndEngine and other games subclass this; AndEngine's
// RenderSurfaceView is a direct subclass.
//
// In v2 we allocate a native MTKView eagerly in the constructor so any
// SurfaceView subclass (including the AndEngine one) ends up with a
// real native drawable that Activity.setContentView can find when it
// walks the view tree. Non-rendering apps that wrap a SurfaceView for
// e.g. video playback will get an unused MTKView -- harmless.
//
// Renderer autodiscovery: many engines (cocos2d-x's FSGLSurfaceView,
// custom Unity wrappers, etc.) re-implement Android's GLSurfaceView
// against javax.microedition.khronos.egl.* and run their own GL
// thread. Those threads can't actually run on macOS (no real Bionic
// EGL on the host) so they die before producing frames. To still
// drive their renderer from our MTKView display link, SurfaceView
// self-registers as a MetalSurfaceCallbacks target and uses
// reflection at draw time to locate the engine's renderer field
// (typically `mRenderer` of a class implementing onDrawFrame). When
// found, macapkDrawFrame() forwards each MTKView vsync to that
// renderer's onDrawFrame so libgame.so's nativeRender hits our
// gl* shims with a current ANGLE EGL context. Engines that subclass
// our v2 android.opengl.GLSurfaceView override these methods and
// take precedence -- this base-class fallback only runs for engines
// that bypass our GLSurfaceView entirely.

    // ======================================================================
    //
    // AOSP (android14-release core/java/android/view/SurfaceView.java):
    //   updateSurface() :985-988
    //       int myWidth = mRequestedWidth;
    //       if (myWidth <= 0) myWidth = getWidth();

    //       if (myHeight <= 0) myHeight = getHeight();
    //   :1120  c.surfaceChanged(mSurfaceHolder, mFormat, myWidth, myHeight);
    //   and the compositor shows that buffer at mScreenRect, the view's own
    //   window rect (:1040-1043), BELOW the window (mSubLayer =
    //   APPLICATION_MEDIA_SUBLAYER, :200) through a hole draw() punches
    //   (:512-521, clearSurfaceViewPort :579-597). setFrame() is overridden
    //   (:478-482: super.setFrame(...); updateSurface();), so every layout
    //   pass re-evaluates the size.
    //
    // Ours handed the holder the DISPLAY surface (the native drawable) and a
    // renderer the WINDOW box (StatusBarDriver.contentBox*), whatever the
    // view's own size, and a lockCanvas frame was presented over the whole
    // window. Measured (docs/fleet-misc-shatteredpd-retrowars-bobball-bouncy-
    // unciv_2026-09-26.md §1): BobBall's SurfaceView is laid out 3360x1560
    // between two HUD rows but was handed 3360x1636 (board 1.049x too big),
    // and bouncy's GLFieldView is 1226x1524 under a 112px ScoreView but its
    // renderer got 1226x1636 (half-dome bumpers, table 1.074x too big).
    //
    // WHAT CHANGES, and the boundary kept on purpose:
    //  * A view that FILLS its window (laid-out size == the root's) keeps the
    //    pre-change answer exactly. Every native consumer we have (Unity,
    //    AGDK/MCPE, native EGL through ANativeWindow, the ANGLE layer) is built
    //    at that size, so changing it there would split the holder from the
    //    layer it describes. That population (HCR, Unity, MCPE, cocos,
    //    fullscreen Canvas games) is untouched by construction. The residual
    //    AOSP gap -- a filling view in a window with VISIBLE bars is told the
    //    display, AOSP tells it the content box -- is OPEN and belongs with
    //    the native layers.
    //  * A view that does NOT fill its window gets its own laid-out size, as
    //    AOSP does: the holder once it has served a lockCanvas (its frame is
    //    then presented AT the view's rect, see macapkPlaceInDisplay /
    //    macapkPresentThroughSurfaceLayer) and, before that, by the renderer
    //    rule, because its consumer may be GL (macapkHolderSurfaceSize); a
    //    renderer only while the view's
    //    bottom-left corner is the ANGLE layer's. The one GL layer is the
    //    window box and GL's origin is its bottom-left, so glViewport(0, 0,
    //    w, h) then lands exactly on the view (bouncy's shape). A GL view
    //    placed anywhere else (a banner BELOW it) keeps the window box until
    //    the ANGLE layer can follow the view's rect natively: told its real
    //    size it would draw shifted, which is worse than drawing too big.
    //  * setFixedSize is left exactly as it was. AOSP gives the buffer the
    //    fixed size and SCALES it to the view; our native layers cannot scale
    //    a fixed buffer, and Unity requests one -- a holder that reports it
    //    while Unity's layer stays display-sized would render into a corner.
    //    OPEN, with the native layers.
    //
    // The view's size is read from a SNAPSHOT published by setFrame on the
    // thread that lays the tree out, never by calling getWidth() on the render
    // thread: a read racing a relayout could see the new root with the old
    // child, flip a filling view to "not filling" for one frame and hand a
    // latching engine (cocos) a wrong size -- the v1.0.742 failure shape
    // StatusBarDriver.contentBoxHeightPx's comment warns about.

    // Our native surface arrives on the render thread's first tick, BEFORE the

    // the renderer used to be created against a view with no size, and a by-NAME

    // What counts as the frame: a layout pass that gives this view a non-empty
    // rect. Not the AGDK content-rect kick (macapkSelfLayout): that lays the
    // view out at the DISPLAY size, which is not where any tree puts it.
    // Two ways a view gets a frame no tree gives it:
    //   * it is its window's content ROOT (a bare GLSurfaceView passed to
    //     setContentView: libGDX, Arc). ViewRootImpl lays the root out at the
    //     window size (performTraversals -> performMeasure/performLayout); here
    //     nothing does, so this view does it itself, at the renderer size, on
    //     the thread that owns the tree.
    //   * a VALVE: FRAME_VALVE_MS after the first RESUMED wait tick with no
    //     frame, a view that has a size anyway (the content-rect kick sized it,
    //     running the app's own onSizeChanged) starts at once, and one with no
    //     size lays itself out the same way; FRAME_VALVE_HARD_MS after it the
    //     renderer starts regardless, WITHOUT a frame (an engine that sizes from
    //     onSizeChanged -- cocos2d-x / axmol -- then gets nativeInit 0x0; the
    //     gate's VALVE-HARD row pins that answer). Logged loudly -- a view
    //     nothing lays out is a tree bug of ours, and a device would show it no
    //     surface. Wall-clock, not render ticks: the tick cadence depends on the
    //     display (preferredFramesPerSecond 120, free-run ~74/s), so a tick
    //     count would mean 1-2 s on one Mac and 1.5-3 s on another. The tick
    //     count is kept for the log only.
    // The flag is a volatile written AFTER super.layout returns, so the app's
    // field writes from onSizeChanged (owner thread) are visible to the render
    // thread that reads the flag before calling onSurfaceCreated.

    //  (1) the runtime's PER-SURFACE layer (MACAPK_SV_SURFACE_LAYER): the
    //      frame goes to a CALayer of its own, at the view's rect, BELOW the
    //      view-tree overlay, and draw() punches the hole AOSP punches. This is
    //      what lets a HUD drawn by sibling views show over the game
    //      (BobBall's "Time Left" / "Score" rows, F2 of the fleet note); on the
    //      shared overlay layer the game thread's frame replaces the view
    //      tree's, last writer wins. Resolved by a capability probe
    //      (NativeCocoa.presentSurfaceBitmap), so this file builds and runs
    //      the same before and after the native half lands.
    //  (2) otherwise, a surface that is NOT display-sized (a non-filling view
    //      under MACAPK_SV_VIEW_SIZE) is composited into a display-sized frame
    //      at its rect before the legacy whole-window present -- which
    //      stretches whatever it is given over the window
    //      (kCAGravityResize), so a view-sized frame handed over as-is would
    //      be stretched anisotropically. Outside the rect the frame is
    //      transparent. The HUD still loses to the game's frame on this route.
    //  Anything else takes the legacy present unchanged.

    // WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-29; measured root cause of Hill Climb Racing
    // 1.68.1's splash stick, and a fleet-wide silent-drop exposure).
    //
    // An app that VENDORS AOSP's GLSurfaceView.java instead of using ours (a
    // "fork" -- cocos2d-x ships FSGLSurfaceView, and it is a common pattern)
    // gets its own private `GLThread` with its own private `mEventQueue`.
    // `queueEvent` on that fork appends to the PRIVATE queue, drained only by
    // that thread's own guardedRun(). Mac.apk deliberately kills the fork's GL
    // thread -- MacApkEGL10.eglCreateContext always returns EGL_NO_CONTEXT /
    // EGL_BAD_CONFIG -- and then drives the renderer reflectively from here
    // instead. Nothing drained the fork's queue, so every runnable posted through
    // it was dropped FOREVER, while onDrawFrame kept ticking: the engine looks
    // alive, no thread appears parked, and a native loading screen that blocks on
    // one of those callbacks waits forever. Measured on HCR 1.68.1: 47,400 frames
    // at a constant `nonzero=155808/5881752 (2%)`, jstack clean, and a
    // GC.class_histogram at t=218s still holding live one-shot Runnables
    // (ConsentManager$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9,
    // MainActivity$1TimeRequestTask$$ExternalSyntheticLambda0) that would have
    // been garbage had they run. The A/B that isolates it: HCR 1.43 renders, ships
    // the SAME fork, takes the SAME EGL kill, and has ZERO app classes queueing
    // to the GL thread (vs 1.68.1's eleven).
    //
    // OUR OWN GLSurfaceView is unaffected and untouched: its queueEvent goes to
    // Handler.enqueueGlThread and is drained by Handler.drainGlobal().
    //
    // WHY DRAINING HERE IS SAFE, where reviving the thread was not: the
    // 2026-06-11 sentinel-EGL-context attempt let the fork's thread LIVE and
    // drain, which entered Stage-6 guest code from a thread the guest runtime
    // never prepared -- HCR 1.68.1 died with a NULL-pc SIGSEGV in nativeOnResume
    // and protected HCR 1.43 regressed to a GC-time crash in
    // frame::sender_for_compiled_frame. Draining on the DRIVING thread runs the
    // runnables on OS-main, the thread already executing nativeRender with ANGLE
    // current, which is also exactly where AOSP runs them (on Android the GL
    // thread IS the renderer thread). No EGL policy change is needed:
    // eglCreateContext must keep failing for every fork, unconditionally.
    // (Correction, v1.0.841: EGL10.EGL_NO_CONTEXT itself became a non-null
    // sentinel, docs/openttd-egl_2026-07-30.md -- that changes an OBJECT'S
    // identity, not whether this method's failure fires. libGDX's GLES3

    //      a running event queues. The v1.0.834 comment read "one event per

    //      stop its own parallel delivery for a fork (every HCR touch was
    //      delivered twice: hcr_run.log 2026-09-25 :46444-46445).
    //  (2) THE VIEW'S CURRENT THREAD. queueEvent goes to whatever GLThread the
    //      view's field holds NOW. A re-attach puts a NEW thread with a NEW
    //      queue there (the fork's onAttachedToWindow, see "A SUCCESSOR OF A

    // ---- EGL10: is this thread a SurfaceView's own GL thread? -----------
    //
    // WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-26, docs/telegram-intro-logo_2026-09-26.md §5).
    // javax.microedition.khronos.egl.MacApkEGL10 used to refuse EVERY
    // eglCreateContext, because an app that vendors AOSP's GLSurfaceView (a
    // "fork": HCR's FSGLSurfaceView, OpenTTD's GLSurfaceView_SDL) must have its
    // private GL thread DIE at eglCreateContext (changelog v1.0.347; the drain
    // above depends on `!t.isAlive()`). That refusal also killed every
    // legitimate app-owned EGL10 thread, such as Telegram's IntroActivity
    // EGLThread rendering into a TextureView. MacApkEGL10 is now a real EGL10
    // over ANGLE and keeps the refusal ONLY for a thread this method names.
    //
    // THE KEY is the same structural one resolveForkedGlQueue uses: a field on
    // a live SurfaceView SUBCLASS chain (up to, not including, SurfaceView)
    // whose value is that Thread. No class or package names, so it is R8-proof.
    // Measured on the app bytecode (debug/appclass.py, 2026-09-26): all three
    // HCR builds (1.43.0, 1.68.1, 1.8.1) declare
    // `private FSGLSurfaceView$GLThread mGLThread` on a class that extends
    // android.view.SurfaceView, and OpenTTD 14.1 declares
    // `private GLSurfaceView_SDL$GLThread mGLThread` the same way. In all four,
    // setRenderer does `putfield mGLThread` BEFORE `GLThread.start()`, so the
    // field is set before the thread can make its first EGL call; there is no
    // ordering race. Telegram's EGLThread is a field of IntroActivity (a
    // BaseFragment, not a View), so it is not matched.
    //
    // Deliberately BROADER than resolveForkedGlQueue on one axis: ANY field
    // holding the thread matches (that walk takes the first Thread-valued
    // field). A false positive here only restores the pre-2026-09-26 refusal,
    // which is the safe side of the fork invariant. A SECOND, reverse key (the
    // thread's own fields point back at a SurfaceView) catches a fork that
    // keeps its thread somewhere other than a view field; see
    // threadHoldsSurfaceView below. Either key matching is enough.
    //
    // The registry holds weak references, so it never keeps a view alive, and

    // CameraGLThreads, FilterGLThread, RenderView$CanvasInternal,

    // ---- Single owner: a renderer is driven by ONE thread ----------------
    //
    // WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-26, docs/openttd-nativeinit-strchr-null_2026-09-26.md).
    // AOSP's threading contract is one renderer, one GL thread, never the UI
    // thread: "The renderer will be called on a separate thread, so that
    // rendering performance is decoupled from the UI thread" (frameworks/base
    // opengl/java/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.java:690, aosp-mirror master,
    // fetched 2026-09-26). The reflected drive in this file (macapkSurfaceChanged
    // / macapkDrawFrame calling a DISCOVERED renderer on OS-main) is Mac.apk's
    // stand-in for an app GL thread that is DEAD -- the vendored-GLSurfaceView
    // forks die at MacApkEGL10's refused eglCreateContext. It used to run
    // unconditionally, so it raced any fork that did NOT die.
    //
    // pelya's libsdl-android fork (OpenTTD's GLSurfaceView_SDL) does not die:
    // its EglHelper.start() only Log.e's an EGL_NO_CONTEXT (bytecode, OpenTTD
    // 14.1: `if_acmpne` over EGL_NO_CONTEXT to a Log.e, no athrow), then
    // createSurface() calls eglCreateWindowSurface, and GLThread.run() calls
    // mRenderer.onDrawFrame ONCE -- which is SDL's whole main loop. With OS-main
    // also calling onDrawFrame, libsdl_main's nativeInit ran twice; it adds to a
    // never-reset `static int argc`, so the second call walked argc=6 over a
    // fresh 3-entry argv and did strchr(argv[3]=NULL, '\t'). The first caller
    // was OS-main, which then sat inside SDL_main forever: no run loop, no
    // present, no input.
    //
    // THE RULE (MACAPK_GL_SINGLE_OWNER, default ON; =0 restores the old
    // unconditional drive exactly): OS-main does not enter this view's
    // reflected renderer while the app's own GL thread
    //   (a) is ALIVE, or
    //   (b) was ever marked a SURVIVOR of the EGL refusal (sticky).
    // While (a) holds the reflected onSurfaceChanged/onSurfaceCreated are
    // DEFERRED, not dropped, and replayed once, in the order macapkSurfaceChanged
    // delivers them, on the first frame the gate opens. Only (a) closes the
    // measured startup race deterministically: OpenTTD's first reflected
    // onSurfaceChanged (run.log:3576) came BEFORE its fork was refused (:3599).
    //
    // REPLAY ORDER (a disagreement, kept visible). The diagnosis note asks for onSurfaceCreated THEN
    // onSurfaceChanged. That would invert the order this path has always used
    // (onSurfaceChanged, setScreenWidthAndHeight, then onSurfaceCreated; see
    // macapkReflectedSurfaceChanged): cocos2d-x's Cocos2dxRenderer.onSurfaceCreated
    // reads screenWidth/screenHeight for nativeInit (bytecode, HCR 1.43.0 /
    // 1.68.1 / 1.8.1: getfield screenWidth/screenHeight inside onSurfaceCreated),
    // so created-first hands HCR a 0x0 viewport. The replay therefore runs the
    // UNCHANGED sequence, just later. The conflict is left visible here on purpose.
    //
    // WHICH THREAD IS "THE APP'S OWN GL THREAD". A Thread-valued field on the
    // view's subclass chain (the forward key macapkIsSurfaceViewGlThread uses),
    // TIGHTENED: the thread must also point back at THIS view (directly or
    // through a Reference: AOSP GLThread's mGLSurfaceViewWeakRef, an inner
    // class's this$0) or hold the discovered renderer itself (pelya's
    // GLThread.mRenderer). A live worker thread a view happens to hold does not
    // close the gate. Measured on the app bytecode (javap, 2026-09-26): HCR
    // 1.43.0 / 1.68.1 / 1.8.1 FSGLSurfaceView holds `FSGLSurfaceView$GLThread
    // mGLThread`, whose `WeakReference<FSGLSurfaceView> mGLSurfaceViewWeakRef`
    // points back; OpenTTD's GLSurfaceView_SDL holds `GLSurfaceView_SDL$GLThread
    // mGLThread`, which holds both `this$0` and `mRenderer`.
    //
    // WHY HCR IS STILL DRIVEN (all three builds, same bytecode shape): its
    // EglHelper.start() does `if (mEglContext == null || mEglContext ==
    // EGL_NO_CONTEXT) throwEglException("createContext")` (AOSP :1062-1064),
    // guardedRun releases the context slot and rethrows, and run()'s finally
    // only calls GLThreadManager.threadExiting -- so the thread dies having made
    // none of the calls that mark a survivor (eglCreateWindowSurface, a real
    // eglMakeCurrent, eglSwapBuffers; createSurface and swap come after start()
    // in guardedRun). The gate opens on the next frame and OS-main drives it as
    // before, one replayed surface delivery later. Verified per build with
    // debug/appclass.py on the converted classes.jar (2026-09-26): start() has
    // `ifnull`/`if_acmpne EGL_NO_CONTEXT` -> throwEglException("createContext")
    // -> `new RuntimeException`; guardedRun's RuntimeException handler around
    // start() is releaseEglContextLocked + athrow; run() catches only
    // InterruptedException. And every sweep/boottime log of all three builds
    // on 2026-09-26 shows `FATAL EXCEPTION: GLThread N` / `createContext failed:
    // 12293` right after the refusal line.
    //
    // DYING COUNTS AS DEAD. A thread whose run() has already thrown is still
    // isAlive() while the VM runs its uncaught-exception handler
    // (java.lang.Thread.dispatchUncaughtException, JDK 21: "called when a
    // thread terminates with an exception"; the thread is only marked dead by
    // JavaThread::exit's ensure_join afterwards). HCR 1.68.1 installs
    // Crashlytics as that handler, and it spent ~2.3 s writing its report for
    // the refused fork (boottime warm log, 2026-09-26 05:39: refusal by
    // 2.50 s, Boot's FATAL line at 4.79 s) -- time in which the pre-fix code was
    // already driving the renderer. Super Jetpack's GLSurfaceViewMortar fork
    // dies EARLIER, never reaching eglCreateContext at all: its
    // IntelligentConfigChooser throws "No configs match configSpec" inside
    // EglHelper.start (it asks for EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE 0x40, ES3, which the
    // legacy table does not advertise), and its Crashlytics handler then sits
    // in "Timeout exceeded while awaiting app exception callback from Analytics
    // listener" (emu_ab_tablet_2026-09-25 run.log:6189-6191). So the rule
    // cannot be keyed on MacApkEGL10's refusal: for ANY thread that owns this
    // renderer, "running its uncaught-exception handler" counts as dead, and a
    // thread in that state can never return to its GL loop. The first frame
    // keeps its pre-fix timing. A survivor is checked first and never takes
    // this path. The fork's EVENT QUEUE still waits for the real death, as it
    // always did (macapkDrainForkedGlQueue keeps its plain isAlive test).
    //
    // A SUCCESSOR OF A DEAD FORK DOES NOT CLOSE THE GATE. An AOSP fork that is
    // detached and re-attached starts a NEW GLThread of the SAME class (AOSP
    // onAttachedToWindow :610-624; HCR 1.43.0 / 1.68.1 / 1.8.1 bytecode, javap
    // 2026-09-26: `if mDetached && mRenderer != null` -> `new
    // FSGLSurfaceView$GLThread(mThisWeakRef)`, putfield mGLThread, start()).
    // That thread waits for a surfaceCreated this class never re-sends
    // (holderSurfaceCreatedFired is latched for the view's life, and
    // SurfaceHolderImpl.fireDestroyed has no caller: we have no detach/attach
    // surface lifecycle at all), so it stays alive forever without reaching
    // EGL. Under the alive rule alone it would close the gate for good and
    // freeze a renderer the pre-fix code kept driving. So once a thread of
    // this view has TERMINATED (or entered its uncaught-exception handler)
    // without surviving, its class is recorded, and a later live thread of
    // that class does not count as the owner: the refusal that killed it is
    // deterministic, so the successor dies the same way if it ever reaches
    // EGL. It can still take the renderer by SURVIVING (rule (b) is checked
    // first). NEW (constructed, not yet started) is not "terminated": HCR's
    // own putfield-then-start() leaves a NEW thread in the field for a moment,
    // and recording that as dead would hand a pelya-shaped fork's renderer to
    // OS-main. Missing piece, not this rule's job: AOSP's surface lifecycle
    // (surfaceDestroyed on detach, surfaceCreated + surfaceChanged on
    // re-attach), without which the successor never runs at all -- exactly as
    // before this change.
