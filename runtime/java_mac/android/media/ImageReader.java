// android.media.ImageReader -- a consumer of Images produced into a Surface.
// AOSP frameworks/base media/java/android/media/ImageReader.java.
//
// This is the CONSUMER END of Mac.apk's camera pipeline, and the only output
// type that actually receives camera frames. The producer end is the
// AVFoundation capture session behind com.macapk.loader.CameraBridge;
// android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSessionImpl joins the two by calling
// macapkAttachCameraSource() on every ImageReader whose Surface is one of the
// session's outputs.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW A FRAME GETS FROM THE CAMERA TO THE APP
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   1. AVFoundation delivers a CVPixelBuffer on its own dispatch queue and the
//      native layer parks it in a one-deep "latest wins" slot.
//   2. The capture session's pump notices the delivered-frame counter advance
//      and calls macapkOnCameraFrame() here.
//   3. We post OnImageAvailableListener.onImageAvailable(this) to the app's
//      Handler, exactly as AOSP does.
//   4. The app calls acquireLatestImage(). That locks the native buffer and
//      hands back an Image whose three Planes are DIRECT ByteBuffers over it --
//      no copy at any point in the chain.
//   5. Image.close() unlocks and releases it. The plane buffers are dead from
//      that instant, which is the same contract as real Android.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE IMAGE AT A TIME, AND WHY THAT DIFFERS FROM maxImages
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The native slot holds exactly one frame, so exactly one Image can be
// outstanding regardless of the maxImages the reader was created with. That is
// stricter than AOSP, where maxImages Images may be held at once. The
// consequences are contained and visible:
//   * While an Image is outstanding, a new frame does NOT raise
//     onImageAvailable -- there is nothing the app could acquire, and firing a
//     callback whose acquire is guaranteed to return null would be a lie.
//   * An app that deliberately holds one Image and acquires a second gets null
//     (which AOSP defines as "no image available") plus one loud log line
//     naming the real reason, so the limitation is diagnosable rather than
//     mysterious.
// The normal camera2 idiom -- acquire and close inside onImageAvailable -- is
// unaffected.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WITH NO CAMERA ATTACHED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// An ImageReader that no capture session ever attached to (a codec output, say)
// behaves exactly as before: acquireLatestImage/acquireNextImage return null,
// which is what AOSP returns when no image is available, and the listener never
// fires because nothing is producing. Nothing here fabricates a frame.
